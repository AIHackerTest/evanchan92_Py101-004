### 0. How to learn everything:
    1. Enforce yourself go into the atmosphere which use this thing a lot, make you surrounded by it;
    2. Start from mimicing, like the baby mimic the motion of his mother to learn how to use the right muscle to speak;
    3. Trial and error: Keep practicing while keep getting information that you do it right or wrong to correct your trajectory;
    4. Know the basic element of the thing, get to know the sailor's language before setting sail;
    5. Following the master, copy every single detail of his, even the errors.
    
### 1. Starting period:
    1. You need to know, what're the biggest hits in teaching Python?
    2. To check if there're comments for those hits;
    3. If you have one which is very popular, try it.
    4. Try to choose those books which emphasis a lot on *Mindset*, because we all follow the rule of *Be-Do-Have* in learning.
    5. Start duplicating the codes your teacher show you, try to make it 100% right with every details.
    
### 2. Marching forwards:
    1. By duplicating some simple start-up codes, you'll start to know some elements and feelings about coding, it seems like similiar to the natural language, at some degree;
    2. Keep mimicing, and write remarks everywhere if you think you don't understand, and note down;
    3. Keep those unclear points, while not rush to discover them immediately, you keep writing and maybe it's right in the next exercise;
    4. Turn to the Internet to find answer if you cannot find it in the book;
    * before searching, you might want to know about some rules for efficient searching, as meta-knowledge.
    
### 3. Bottleneck period:
    1. Every man could have bottleneck period in everything, it's very normal, believe it;
    2. Emphasise the points got you here, what drives you at the beginning and where's the destination;
    3. Write WOOP for coding to ensecure your motivation and action;
    4. Build the atmosphere which makes you feel safe/ concentrated/ flow...
    * If you do have something more important, finish it, and finish it quickly!
